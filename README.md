💬 HR Helper: Employee FAQ Chatbot

Your 24/7 Smart HR Support Assistant

HRHelper is an intelligent Slack chatbot built to automate employee interactions by answering frequently asked HR-related questions—like leave policies, benefits, working hours, and more.

🚀 How It Works

A user messages the bot on Slack (e.g., "What is the leave policy?").
The Flask backend receives the message via the Slack Events API.
It checks against a pre-defined data.json FAQ dataset.
If a match is found, the bot responds instantly in Slack.
If no answer exists, the question is logged for HR review.
