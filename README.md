💬 HR Helper: Employee FAQ Chatbot
Your 24/7 Smart HR Support Assistant
HRHelper is an intelligent Slack chatbot designed to automate employee interactions by answering frequently asked HR-related questions—like leave policies, benefits, working hours, and more.

🚀 How It Works
User Interaction: A user messages the bot on Slack (e.g., "What is the leave policy?").
Backend Processing: The Flask backend receives the message via the Slack Events API.
Data Matching: It checks against a pre-defined data.json FAQ dataset.
Instant Response: If a match is found, the bot responds instantly in Slack.
Logging for Improvement: If no answer exists, the question is logged for HR review.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 100 realistic HR-related Q&A pairs covering:
Policies: Leave, insurance, holidays
Greetings: Polite interactions like “Hello”, “Good morning”, “Thank you”
FAQs: Exit, appraisal, attendance, and payroll-related questions
